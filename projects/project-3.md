summary: My past as a musician/clarinet player over 14 years
---

Over the past 14 years, I have labeled myself as a musician. Since I was in 6th grade, I have been playing clarinet almost every year besides a small hiatus from 2019 - 2021. I have played all over the United States as well as a few different countries.

I first started out at Evergreen Middle School in Everett, WA just north of Seattle. That was when I first found one of my biggest passions in life: music. Ever since I picked up a clarinet for the first time, I could hardly set it down. When I moved to Arlington, WA that was about 30 minutes north of Everett, I became more enthused by music. I played all the time and my band director quickly took note. During my 7th grade year, he nominated me to play at the state honor band for middle schools. It was my first time really playing in a good sounding ensemble. From there, I moved on to high school at North Kitsap High School in Poulsbo, WA (a ferry ride from Seattle on the Olympic Peninsula). It was then that I really took music seriously. During the summer of my Sophomore year, I participated in a festival called Marrowstone Music Festival at Western Washington University that was hosted by the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra. It was my first ever time playing in an orchestra and most certainly not my last. I also went back to Marrowstone for my Junior year but before that, I auditioned for the Seattle Youth Symphony for my junior year and I got in. It was without a doubt one of the best ensembles I've ever been in, if not THE best. During junior year I also participated in the All State Concert Band where the best musicians from all over Washington state come to perform for one day iover Presidents Day weekend. Additionally, I played for Pacific Lutheran University Honor Band during Junior year as well. It was a very busy year for me. During my senior year, I played with the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra again where I also had the opportunity to play with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra at Benaroya Hall in Seattle. 

After high school, I attended Central Washington University in Ellensburg, WA. It is the best music school in Washington, if not the west coast, and I was able to play with some of my close friends that I made in high school. I dropped out after 1 year because I realized that I didn't want to major in music education and performance. After my time at CWU, I decided to live at home with my mom and my younger brother until I figured out what I wanted to do. While working for Panera, a Marine Corps recruiter talked to me and asked what I was planning on doing. I told him that I was planning on going back to school for music and he asked me what 
instrument I played. When I told him clarinet, he told me that they have an opening for the Marine Corps Bands for a clarinet player and asked if I wanted to audition. I told him yes, and won the audition. After boot camp and combat training, I went to the Naval School of Music and eventually got stationed in Okinawa, Japan and Quantico, VA where I was able to travel the world and play with some great musicians. Now, I play with the Wind Ensemble at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
