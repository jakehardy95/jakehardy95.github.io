summary: My experience building an app for HACC
---

This year, a few of my classmates and I decided to participate in the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC) to get some experience building applications outside of the classroom. The HACC has around 5 challenges/applications that you can build and then they are judged. If you make it to the judging round, you can win up to $4000 for your team.

Our team chose to build the Hawaii Marine Animal Response Reporting and Sighting application. To achieve this, we decided to use Meteor, React, MongoDB, and Semantic UI to build the app. The link can be found here: "". Throughout the process, we learned a lot including notification pushing, form handling and submission, as well as user login and account creation. The biggest thing that I took away from this project is how great it is to work in teams and be able to accomplish a goal, especially through the resources that Github provides.
